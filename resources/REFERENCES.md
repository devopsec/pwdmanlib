Although much of the code here is hand-written, other than the dependecies of course, but I would not have been able to accomplish any of this without help from various community members.\s\s
Through conducting research, posting on forums, asking colleagues, taking college courses, discussing with professors, and tutorial after programming tutorial, I was able to learn all of the concepts necessary.\s\s
This document serves to give credit to some of these amazing people for all their hard work and to provide links to these resources so we can spread the knowledge. I'll do my best to send out notices appropiately, to ensure the authors are aware as well.\s\s
Thank you for the making c-programming awesome again, happy hacking, and more importantly **emphasized** __keep calm and code on__.
